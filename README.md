# availity-reactstrap-validation

Easy to use React validation components compatible for reactstrap.

## This is not the original availity package

This release is an interim publishing of a [commit](https://github.com/nylon22/availity-reactstrap-validation/commit/2c7f63177928da3e27e393ecaa18b88a8038546d#diff-b9cfc7f2cdf78a7f4b91a753d10865a2) on issue [#15](https://github.com/Availity/availity-reactstrap-validation/issues/15) which addresses shortcomings which makes availity not work well with mobx.

This is (hopefully) **NOT** a long-lived release, it exists until something more official is released.
